# 100 Mini Projects 

This repository is my attempt to complete Florin Pop's "100 Days - 100 Projects" challenge, using mainly React.js, HTML, and CSS. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of Reactjs. 

I plan to continuously update this repository as I progress through the challenge.


## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../name
$ npm install
